# class-final-project
This repository contains an application inspired by an original group project developed for an Object-Oriented Programming course.

As a team of four students, we designed and built a desktop application that helps users track their daily routines and manage personal self-care products.

The project began as a skincare routine tracker, but was later expanded into a more flexible and generalized routine management tool. The updated version supports a wider range of products, including skincare, medications, and other self-care items, allowing users to organize both morning and evening routines in one place.

In addition to broadening the scope of the application, the interface was redesigned to improve usability and introduce new features, followed by a round of bug fixes and refinements to enhance stability and overall user experience.

This project highlights our work in object-oriented design, user interface development, collaboration in a team environment, and iterative software improvement.
